# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing after the TypeScript migration due to configuration issues.

## Root Causes
1. **Unnecessary build command**: Vercel serverless functions can run TypeScript files directly without compilation
2. **Frontend dependencies in production**: React, Framer, and Framer Motion were added as production dependencies when they're only needed for the component (which runs in Framer, not Vercel)
3. **TypeScript compilation not needed**: Vercel handles TypeScript files natively for serverless functions

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Build Command from vercel.json
```diff
- "buildCommand": "npm run build",
```
Vercel doesn't need to build TypeScript files - it runs them directly.

### 2. Cleaned Up Dependencies
```diff
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^17.2.1",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
-   "framer": "^2.3.0",
-   "framer-motion": "^10.13.1",
-   "react": "^18.2.0"
  },
```
These dependencies are only needed in Framer, not on Vercel.

### 3. Updated package.json Scripts
```diff
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vercel dev",
-   "build": "tsc",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "deploy": "vercel --prod",
```
Removed the build script as it's not needed for deployment.

### 4. Updated tsconfig.json
```diff
- "outDir": "./dist",
- "sourceMap": true,
- "declaration": true,
- "declarationMap": true,
+ "noEmit": true,
```
TypeScript is now only used for type checking during development.

## How Vercel Handles TypeScript

- Vercel serverless functions support TypeScript natively
- No compilation step is needed
- The `.ts` files are executed directly
- TypeScript is transpiled on-the-fly during deployment

## Component Usage

The `SpotifyNowPlaying.tsx` component is not deployed to Vercel. Instead:
1. Copy the component code to Framer
2. Framer handles the TypeScript/JSX compilation
3. The component calls your deployed Vercel API

## Deployment Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. No build step is needed
4. TypeScript files are handled automatically

## Verification

After deployment, verify:
- API endpoint works: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/spotify/now-playing`
- No build errors in Vercel dashboard
- Component in Framer can connect to the API

## Local Development

For local TypeScript checking:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

This ensures type safety without creating build artifacts.
